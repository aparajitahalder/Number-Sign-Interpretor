This is an Artificial intelligence project based on CNN which predicts the number sign languages through gesture.


1. First run the "collectdata.ipynb" file
2. Then train the model by running "sign_train.ipynb" file
3. Then predict the signs by running the "sign_predict.ipynb" file 
4. You can also directly run the predict file as the trained models are saved in "___.h5" files.
